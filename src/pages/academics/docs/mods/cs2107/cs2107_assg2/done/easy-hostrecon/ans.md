1. `nmap 178.128.126.127` port scan the ip
2. open ports are `22`, `80`, `8080`, `443`.
3. default, http port 80 `http://178.128.126.127` is some lame joke
4. https, port `443`, is some github user [MechFroG88](https://github.com/MechFroG88)'s personal project called "The Revolution". Game too long, skipped.
5. Accessing `http://178.128.126.127:8080/` gives the answer.
6. `CS2107{D-Don't look at me...BAKA!}`.
